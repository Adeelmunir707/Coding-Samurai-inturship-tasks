# Machine Learning Projects

# Project Showcase

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I've documented three exciting Machine Learning projects! In these projects, I have explored various aspects of machine learning and natural language processing to tackle real-world problems. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each project, along with links to their respective code and documentation.

## 1. Flower Classification using Iris Dataset

### Project Overview
In this project, I have built a flower classification model using the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset contains measurements of various iris flower species, and we use machine learning to classify them accurately.

### Code and Documentation
- **Code:** [Iris Flower Classification](https://github.com/Adeelmunir707/Coding-Samurai-inturship-tasks/blob/main/flower-species/flower-sepecies-prediction-iris-dataset.ipynb)
- **Documentation:** Check out the [Iris Flower Classification Notebook](https://github.com/Adeelmunir707/Coding-Samurai-inturship-tasks/blob/main/flower-species/flower-sepecies-prediction-iris-dataset.ipynb) for detailed explanations and code.

## 2. Movie Recommendation System

### Project Overview
In this project, I've created two movie recommendation systems: one based on cosine similarity and another using content-based filtering. These recommendation systems help users discover new movies based on their preferences and similarities between movies.

### Code and Documentation
- **Data-set:** [Movie Recommender using tmdb_5000_movies](https://github.com/Adeelmunir707/Coding-Samurai-inturship-tasks/blob/main/movies-recomender/Datasets.zip)
- **Cosine Similarity - Code:** [Movie Recommender using Cosine Similarity](https://github.com/Adeelmunir707/Coding-Samurai-inturship-tasks/blob/main/movies-recomender/movie-recomendation-system.ipynb)
- **Documentation:** Explore the Jupyter Notebooks in the respective repositories for detailed information on each recommendation approach.

## 3. Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Tweets Dataset

### Project Overview
In this project, I have developed a sentiment analysis model to analyze Twitter tweets. The model classifies tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, providing insights into public opinions on various topics.

### Code and Documentation
- **Code:** [Sentiment Analysis on Twitter](https://github.com/Adeelmunir707/Coding-Samurai-inturship-tasks/blob/main/Sentiment-analysis/social-media-sentiment-analysis.ipynb)

### Web app to analyze yout thoughts
- **Pulsefixer:** [Web-app](https://pulsefixer.streamlit.app/)


## 4. Bonus: User Interface with Streamlit

I have also created user-friendly web interfaces for the movie recommender and sentiment analyzer using Streamlit. These interfaces make it easy for users to interact with the models and get recommendations or sentiment analysis results.

- **Movie Recommender UI:** [Movie Recommender Interface](https://github.com/Adeelmunir707/Coding-Samurai-inturship-tasks/blob/main/movies-recomender/app.py)
- **Sentiment Analyzer UI:** [Sentiment Analyzer Interface](https://github.com/Adeelmunir707/Coding-Samurai-inturship-tasks/blob/main/Sentiment-analysis/app.py)

Feel free to explore each project, run the code, and contribute to their development. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out!
